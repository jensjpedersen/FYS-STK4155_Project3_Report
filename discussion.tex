\subsection{Manual feature selection}


% Identify features with poor class separation

% Identify highly correlated features  
% * plot correlation matrix

\subsection{Compare Manual VS Automatic feature reduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the Automatic selection method as expected, compared with visual
        inspection, manual feature reduction.   
\end{itemize}
